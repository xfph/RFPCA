# Description
1. The folder prog contains function files of our proposed RFPCA method and other related methods.
2. The folder expr contains the codes for sections 4.1 and 4.3.2 in the paper.

You can run demo.m in the simulation subfolder to reproduce the results of the simulated experiments in the paper, and run demo_err_aus.m in the MTS subfolder to show the lowest classification error rates by different methods on the AUSLAN dataset.

See readme.txt for more details.
